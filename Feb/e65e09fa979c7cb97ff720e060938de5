The JSE was weaker on Wednesday afternoon, while its global peers were mixed as investors await developments in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Local focus will be on finance minister Enoch Godongwana’s budget maiden speech. Equity markets are mixed after the US and Europe imposed new sanctions on Russia after it formally recognised two breakaway provinces of Ukraine and started moving peacekeeping military equipment into them. “The West has imposed strong sanctions against Russia in response to Moscow’s moves in Ukraine, and markets now await further developments,” said TreasuryONE currency strategist Andre Cilliers. “Minister Enoch Godongwana’s maiden budget speech is due later today. Analysts are expecting a reasonably positive address.” At 1.35pm, the JSE all share had lost 0.85% to 75,007 points and the top 40 0.99%.
