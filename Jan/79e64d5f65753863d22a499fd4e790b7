This follows data on Wednesday that showed consumer inflation reached 7% year on year in December, its highest level since 1982. Tech stocks were under pressure on Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling 2.5%. In morning trade on Friday, Japan’s Nikkei was down 1.43% and the Hang Seng 1.03%, while the Shanghai Composite had given back 0.25%. Tencent, which influences the JSE via Naspers, had lost 2.51%.
