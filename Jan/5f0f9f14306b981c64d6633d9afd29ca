Stor-Age Property, SA’s largest listed personal storage provider, tapped shareholders for R575m in an oversubscribed book build on Thursday, looking to further boost its growing footprint in an asset class it says has been consistently resilient through economic cycles. Stor-Age, valued at R6.33bn on the JSE, also announced  on Thursday it had inked a £37.5m (R782m) deal to buy four self-storage properties in the UK — the latest deal from a group that has grown the value of its portfolio eightfold since listing in 2015. The group’s shares fell as much as 4.5% in response, but had pared losses to trade 2.08% lower at R14.57 in afternoon trade, on track for their worst day in almost two months. Stor-Age ultimately raised R575m, having eyed R550m, citing strong demand as it issued 40.21-million new shares — about 10% — at a 0.92% discount. Stor-Age has made clear it has been looking to build scale in a property class boosted by certain consumer trends that have  accelerated during Covid-19. Logistics-focused property groups have benefited from the pandemic as the lockdown restrictions drove e-commerce and prompted many companies to rethink their office needs, with Stor-Age saying  rentals grew by an annualised 6.3% in SA, and 6% in the UK, during its first quarter to end-December. The onset of the pandemic gave rise to new demand drivers for self-storage, including a boost to home improvements and renovations, as well as an increase in the mobility of many employees who are working remotely. Stor-Age was listed in November 2015, 10 years after its formation, and then expanded into the UK by buying Storage King in September 2017. Since listing, the value of the group’s properties in the total portfolio has risen from 24, worth R1bn, to 76 worth R8bn. The group had 54 properties in SA and 22 in the UK as of the end of September. Stor-Age said on Thursday the four properties it intends to buy have a gross lettable area of 12,400m², compared to 449,100 for the group as of the end of September, with 88,500 of this in the UK. The group also has a significant development pipeline of properties. Its SA pipeline of 10 properties will add an estimated 59,200m² at  total cost of R850m, and its  four properties in the UK  will add an estimated 20,500 at an expected cost of £46m. As of the end of the group's 2021 year, it had net debt of just less than R2bn, with more than half of this debt in pounds, and a loan-to-value (LTV) of 25%. LTV is a measure of indebtedness, with Stor-Age having a target range of 25% to 35%.
