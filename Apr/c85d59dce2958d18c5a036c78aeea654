New-vehicle sales in SA exceeded expectations last month, recording the highest monthly total since pre-pandemic October 2019. The Naamsa automotive business council reported that 50,607 new cars, light commercials and trucks were sold in March — an increase of 7,184 units (16.5%) over the 43,423 vehicles sold in March 2021. It’s been a good first quarter for the local motor industry. In the first three months the biggest growth has been in the passenger car market, and year to date 93,377 cars have been sold, a 25.4% rise over the same period last year. Light commercials have improved by a smaller 2.9% to 35,888 units in the first three months of 2022. However, SA’s top-selling vehicle remains a light commercial: the Toyota Hilux, and by quite a margin. With 4,561 sales last month it more than doubled the number of its nearest competitor. Market leader Toyota set a new record of 15,008 sales last month, helped by the strong popularity of models such as the Corolla Cross which was the country’s best-selling passenger car, the Hiace (top-selling minibus) and the Starlet budget hatchback. Alongside bakkies, the budget car and compact SUV segments continue to lure large numbers of SA consumers. In the budget category the VW Polo Vivo and new-generation Polo continue to rule sales, while Toyota dominates the compact SUV league with the Corolla Cross and Urban Cruiser. Suzuki also recorded a new domestic sales record of 3,347 units in March for a near 10% share of the passenger vehicle market and a top five position among SA’s best-selling brands. Electric vehicles (EVs) are still selling at a trickle compared to internal combustion engined (ICE) cars, but the momentum is picking up after the introduction of new models. EV sales more than doubled to 218 units in SA in 2021 with the recent launches of battery-powered cars such as the BMW iX and Audi E-Tron, off a very low base of 92 EVs sold in 2020. The list below gives a snapshot of what vehicles South Africans are buying, although the numbers are not driven purely by popularity as supply constraints caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war are affecting some brands worse than others. Since 2020 there has been a global semiconductor chip shortage affecting the automotive industry, and this year several automakers have been forced to cut their production after reduced supplies of wiring harnesses from war-hit Ukraine.
