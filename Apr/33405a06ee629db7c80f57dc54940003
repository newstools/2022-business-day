Mzansi has been celebrating internationally acclaimed DJ Black Coffee for his  Grammy win. The star bagged the Grammy Award for the best dance/electronic music album for his album, Subconsciously. Taking to Twitter, Mzansi had nothing but praise and admiration for his win, with some calling the star a legend. “Ladies and gentlemen, Grammy award winner Black Coffee. Let that sink in. Congratulations, Grootmaan,” tweeted Lasizwe Dambuza. “A little boy named Nkosinathi Innocent Sizwe Maphumulo from  KwaZulu-Natal grew up to become a Grammy winner on  April 3 2022. Black child, it is possible. Congratulations Black Coffee,” wrote one tweep. On Instagram the same energy was carried through  and congratulatory posts  flooded in. “SA please stand up as we bow to our brother @realblackcoffee for representing SA on the world stage and bringing home the ultimate honour in music, the Grammy Award, as the first SA DJ to do so in the history of SA music,” wrote businessperson Lebo Gunguluza. SA was well-represented at the Grammys. Comedian Trevor Noah hosted the 64th Grammy ceremony on Sunday night, becoming the first South African to  do so. Speaking after the win, Black Coffee said it was an award for all of Africa. “African kids who are watching, they may think they don’t stand a chance to get on a global stage like this. I want to just say to them  it is possible. The award is not just for me, and it’s not just about music alone, this is about anything  they want to do. This Grammy is a symbol of that, that it’s possible to get here”. Here are some of the reactions:
